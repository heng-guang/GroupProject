  We are a trio of students from SMU Masters of Information Technology in Business who took the module ISSS608 Visual Analytics. 
  
  This website contains a collection of works for our group project "REALVIS", a visualization of analytical methods we've applied to datasets for Singapore's Private Property Transactions.
